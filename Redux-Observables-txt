epic
----
Epic is a fn that takes actions and returns new actions 
At a high level, when you use Redux-observable in your application, 
you need to provide a function with an Observable input and 
an Observable output. This function is called an epic.
The Observable input represents all actions dispatched in the application 
and the Observable output represents all down-stream actions 
triggered by your async logic. 
More succinctly, it calls for actions in, actions out.

Epics are very similar to reducer functions in Redux.
With one difference,
Reducer returns a state, whereas Epic returns stream of actions
